- Jobly is a job searching API using JWT tokens for AUTH

First task was to write tests and documentation for sqlForPartialUpdate

Next, added filtering to Company.findAll()
    Can now pass in filters in a query string (All Optional):
        - name
        - minEmployees
        - maxEmployees

Thirdly, Fixed AUTH for companies and Users using middleware
    specially ensureAdmin() and ensureUserorAdmin()
    Companies and Users Auth tested.

Fourth Jobs. companies can have serveral jobs.
    On equity col we use the Numeric field type because it provides
    more specific requires on the value. Numeric field takes in two
    arguements (precision, scale). Precision is total digits, scale
    is amout of digits to right of decimal and they are exact.

    Job model based off Company model, similar architecture/filtering.
    Added jobs array to companies. Get /companies/:handle

Finally, added User.applyToJob() method and /:username/jobs/:id route
    to allow user to apply for a job.
